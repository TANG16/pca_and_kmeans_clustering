===================================
NOTE - The entire lab is implemented in MATLAB

For implementation purposes the file data.txt and label.txt should be just outside the code directory (in the parent directory).

The code folder contains the following scripts -

1.)  Lab4.m                 : Main script which needs to be run.
2.)  K_means.m              : To perform K-means clustering on given data.
3.)  PCA.m                  : To perform PCA on given data.

The final test script is Lab4.m

How To Run :

In the Matlab window type - Lab4

The code will ask for user input. Follow user prompt to implement each experiment.
